## Overview

The **PLR operations** are the foundation of the Tonnetz. 
They act on major and minor triads.  
**Triad** is any combination of any three distinct Pitch Classes. In the Neo-Riemannian theory the major and the minor triads are of interest that are equivalent to the groups $\{n, \; n+4, \; n+7\}$ \& $\{n, \; n+3, \; n+7 \}$ accordingly, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$.
PLR stand for :
- **P :** Parallel.
- **L :** Leading-Tone Exchange. 
- **R :** Relative.

These operations/ transformations are the principal transformations of the Neo-Riemmanian theory which was mainly conceived by David Lewin (1933â€“2003).
The mirror process is relative to the chord intervalic relations not the position of the shape in the circle.


#### PLR as Group Operations

The PLR group acts simply transitively on the set $ \left{  n_M,n=0â€¦11 \right} \cup \left{ n_m,n=0â€¦11 \right} $ of the 24 major and minor triads, where $n_M$ (resp. $n_m$) represents a major (resp. minor) triad with root n in the usual semi-tone encoding of pitch classes.

It is isomorphic to the dihedral group D24 of order 24, and is generated by the following two transformations.

The transformation $L:\mathbb{Z}_{24} \to \mathbb{Z}_{24}$ is called the leading-tone operation, and is such that:

$$
L(n_M)=(n+4)_m  \textrm{ and the complementary }  L(n_m)=(n+8)_M     
$$


The transformation $R:\mathbb{Z}_{24} \to \mathbb{Z}_{24}$ is called the relative operation, and is such that:

$$
R(n_M)=(n+9)_m   \textrm{ and similarly the complementary } 
$$

Though not a generator, the operation $P=(RL)3R$, called the parallel operation, is often considered, and is such that $P(n_M)=n_m$
