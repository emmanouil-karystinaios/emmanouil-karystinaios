But first, we have to answer the following questions :\n What is performance similarity How to measure siilarity in match scores? Which similarity metric to use ? Why measure performance similarity? What elements affect our perception of performance similarity?   Self-Similarity Matrices The concept of self-similarity matrices is fundamental for capturing structural properties of music recordings. Generally, one starts with a feature space L containing the elements of the feature sequence under consideration as well as with a similarity measure $f : \\mathcal{L} \\times \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Interval Vectors  Definition An interval vector is an array of natural numbers which summarize the intervals present in a set of pitch classes.

They act on major and minor triads.\nTriad is any combination of any three distinct Pitch Classes. In the Neo-Riemannian theory the major and the minor triads are of interest that are equivalent to the groups ${n, ; n+4, ; n+7}$ \u0026amp; ${n, ; n+3, ; n+7 }$ accordingly, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. PLR stand for :\n P : Parallel. L : Leading-Tone Exchange. R : Relative.  These operations/ transformations are the principal transformations of the Neo-Riemmanian theory which was mainly conceived by David Lewin (1933–2003). The mirror process is relative to the chord intervalic relations not the position of the shape in the circle.\nPLR as Group Operations The PLR group acts simply transitively on the set $ \\left{ n_M,n=0…11 \\right} \\cup \\left{ n_m,n=0…11 \\right} $ of the 24 major and minor triads, where $n_M$ (resp. $n_m$) represents a major (resp. minor) triad with root n in the usual semi-tone encoding of pitch classes.\nIt is isomorphic to the dihedral group D24 of order 24, and is generated by the following two transformations.\nThe transformation $L:\\mathbb{Z}{24} \\to \\mathbb{Z}{24}$ is called the leading-tone operation, and is such that:\n$$ L(n_M)=(n+4)_m \\textrm{ and the complementary } L(n_m)=(n+8)_M $$\nThe transformation $R:\\mathbb{Z}{24} \\to \\mathbb{Z}{24}$ is called the relative operation, and is such that:\n$$ R(n_M)=(n+9)_m \\textrm{ and similarly the complementary } $$\nThough not a generator, the operation $P=(RL)3R$, called the parallel operation, is often considered, and is such that $P(n_M)=n_m$\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://emmanouil-karystinaios.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Harmonic Trajectories in the Tonnetz","type":"post"},{"authors":["Emmanouil Karystinaios","Corentin Guichaoua","Moreno Andreatta","Louis Bigo","Isabelle Bloch"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
