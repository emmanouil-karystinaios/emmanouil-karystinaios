But first, we have to answer the following questions :\n What is performance similarity How to measure siilarity in match scores? Which similarity metric to use ? Why measure performance similarity? What elements affect our perception of performance similarity?   Self-Similarity Matrices The concept of self-similarity matrices is fundamental for capturing structural properties of music recordings. Generally, one starts with a feature space L containing the elements of the feature sequence under consideration as well as with a similarity measure $f : \\mathcal{L} \\times \\mathcal{L} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Interval Vectors  Definition An interval vector is an array of natural numbers which summarize the intervals present in a set of pitch classes. There is an equivalence between complementary intervals within the octave for example $2^{nd}$ minor and $7^{nth}$ major intervals, etc.  Examples :\n Any Major chord : $ [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 ] $ Any Minor chord : $ [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 ] $   Interval Vectors and Cadences    Typical Cadences      $\\textrm{V}$ \u0026amp; - \u0026amp; $\\textrm{I}$ authentic   $\\textrm{I}$ \u0026amp; - \u0026amp; $\\textrm{V}$ half   $\\textrm{IV}$ \u0026amp; - \u0026amp; $\\textrm{I}$ plagal   $\\textrm{V}$ \u0026amp; - \u0026amp; $\\textrm{VI}$ deceptive    Interval Vectors are commutative, i.e. $\\textrm{V} \\to \\textrm{I} = \\textrm{I} \\to \\textrm{V} $:\n $ (\\textrm{V/I})_{maj} = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0] $ $ (\\textrm{V/I})_{min} = [2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0] $   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  For every window $w_i^j$ we compute the interval vector of all notes in thye window/ Therefore, $\\textrm{Int_Vec}(w_i^j)\\in \\mathbb{N}^6$. $$ \\mathcal(W) = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^\\nu \\textrm{Int_Vec}(w_i^j) $$ Then, let $\\mathcal{X}$ be some matrix decomposition of $\\mathcal{W}$.
